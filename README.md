# marketwatch_scraper
Python file for scraping Marketwatch webpage to get financial statements of S&P500 companies

This program gets financial statments of companies from S&P500 index for 15 years and saves them as html file.
For now I have saved just part of that data, because whole dataset would take gigabytes.
The next step is to scrap all these html files and insert all necessary data into dataframes.
